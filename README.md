# Bike-O-MAT
An online-bike-renting-system consisting of two main parts:
A database to manage the status and location of each bike and a web-application as an easy interface for customers.

The database is an SQL-Server hosted on Microsoft Azure and contains data like customer information as well as available bikes, their status, location, brand, type, etc.
The web-application enables customers to choose the bike they want, query the location of it and book it online on the website or via the qr-code on each bike.
